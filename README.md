PROBLEM
> Around 67 million tonnes of food is wasted in India every year which has been valued at around Rs 92,000 crores. For context, this amount is enough to feed all of Bihar for a year    
> Annually, nearly 21 million metric tonnes of wheat rots in India. This figure is equal to Australia’s total annual production    
> According to old 2018 BMC data, Mumbai generates close to 9,400 metric tonnes of solid waste per day, from which 73% is food, vegetable, and fruit waste, while only 3% is plastic.     
> National Delhi also generates around 9,000 metric tonnes of waste per day, with the country’s largest landfill located in East Delhi.    
> Economic Impact:    
>     
> Food Wastage not only leads to negative environmental impact but also causes economic loss. According to an FAO report, approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted. The economic costs of this food wastage are substantial and amount to about $1 trillion each year. However, the hidden costs of food wastage extend much further.  In addition to the $1 trillion of economic costs per year, environmental costs reach around $700 billion and social costs around $900 billion.
